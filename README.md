## Support us

Roots is an independent open source org, supported only by developers like you. Your sponsorship funds [WP Packages](https://wp-packages.org/) and the entire Roots ecosystem, and keeps them independent. Support us by purchasing [Radicle](https://roots.io/radicle/) or [sponsoring us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/roots) — sponsors get access to our private Discord.

## [WP Packages vs WPackagist](https://wp-packages.org/wp-packages-vs-wpackagist)

|  | WP Packages | WPackagist |
|---|---|---|
| Package naming | `wp-plugin/*` `wp-theme/*` | `wpackagist-plugin/*` `wpackagist-theme/*` |
| Package metadata | Includes authors, description, homepage, and support links | Missing — [requested since 2020](https://github.com/outlandishideas/wpackagist/issues/305) |
| Update frequency | Every 5 minutes | ~1.5 hours (estimated) |
| Composer v2 `metadata-url` | ✅ | ❌ |
| Composer v2 `metadata-changes-url` | ✅ | ❌ |
| Install statistics | ✅ | ❌ |
| Untagged plugin installs | Immutable — pinned to SVN revision | Mutable, resulting in unexpected plugin updates |

### Composer resolve times

Cold resolve (no cache) — lower is better:

| Plugins | WP Packages | WPackagist | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 plugins | 0.7s | 12.3s | 17x faster |
| 20 plugins | 1.1s | 19.0s | 17x faster |
